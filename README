SAFL

SAFL is a set of Semi-Automatic Feature Location and parameter
estimation tools for computer vision problems. Mostly intended to
perform camera calibration tasks where you need to manually identify
which set of points correspond to each other in sets of images, or
which lines from an image correspond to which vanishing point.
